\section{Coppertwait}
Coppertwait's rainfall models have been used for decades with a good deal of sucess. Although we will not dive deep into his methodology the following papers may be refferenced if one wishes too **ref all coppertwait papers**.

Over time, Coppertwait has improved and adjusted his model for varying applications. For example, in one of his more recent papers **ref 2010 paper**, Coppertwait has turned the discrete variable describing the type of storm into a continous one. This changes and developments, while interesting, are not the focus of our paper. Instead, we will focus on **ref 1994 paper** to understand the model at its simplicity and one may apply these ideas to a Hidden Markov Model. 

All of Coppertwaits models use a Neyman-Scott point processes to describe the arrival of Storms. The model itself can be described as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The origin of each storm is a Poisson process in space-time
    \item Each storm is a circular region in two dimensional space with radii given by independent exponential random variables.
    \item Each storm generates a cluster of two dimensional circular rain cells with random duration, poistion and radius. 
    \item The duration of each cell is an exponential random variable.
    \item The intensity of each cell is a random exponential distributed but dependent on the type of cell. In **ref 1994** we have two cell types, light and heavy.
    \item Overall intensity at any point is given by the sum of overlaping intensities at the point in space and time.
\end{itemize}

The GNSRP Model, discussed in **ref paper 1994**, is a generalisation of the Neyman-Scott-Rectangular-Pulse (NSRP) Model with only one cell type. The key feature of the NSRP is that, in addition to those above, the distance from Cell origins to its Storm origin are independently exponentially distributed. Unlike other models that used and independent uniform distribution for this, NSRP accounted for the realistic effect that rainfall tends to be more intense near the center of the storm ** ref browning**.

\section{Grando - HMM Based Model}
\label{grando}
\subsection{Model}
Grando extended on Coppertwait's ideas in **ref paper**. She completely removes the double disc structure and attempts to enclose the correlations within the larger Storm discs from Coppertwait in Hidden Markov States.

She defines her discrete time intensity process as follows:
For $n \geq 1$ and $x \in A$, where $A \subset \mathbb{R}^2$
\begin{equation}
    I_n(x) := \sum_{i=1}^{N^{(n)}} \sigma_i^{(n)} \mathbb{I}_{D(x_i^{(n)},R_i^{(n)})} (x)
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $I_n(x)$ is the rain intensity
    \item $N^{(n)} \sim$ Pois($\lambda$) represents the number of rain discs generated
    \item $\sigma_i^{(n)} \sim$ Exp($\tau$) is a random variable providing the rain intensity
    \item  $D(x_i^{(n)},R_i^{(n)})$ is a rain disc with centre $x_i^{(n)} \sim$ Unif($A$) and radius $R_i^{(n)} \sim$ Exp($\xi$).
    \item $\mathbb{I}_{D(x_i^{(n)},R_i^{(n)})} (x)$ is an indicator function, equal to 1 if the current rain disc overlaps position $x$.
\end{itemize}

Parameters $\lambda$,$\xi$ and $\tau$ are taken to be fixed for each type of storm. In other words, for each hidden state of the HMM there is a unique $\lambda$,$\xi$ and $\tau$. Informally, the model has hidden states which determine the type of storm. This then dictates the values of the three above parameters, which in turn influence the intensity of rain observed.

Thus we arrive at the learning problem. Due to the added complexity of additional parameters we are unable to directly use methods for HMMs discussed earlier in the paper. Direct likelihood calculation is complex for HMMs alone, after we introduce these additional parameters it is not feasible. 

Given the model has $m$ states, we will have $m^2+4m$ unknown parameters, $m^2$ for the transition probabilities, $m$ for the intitial distribution and $m$ for each of $\lambda$,$\xi$ and $\tau$.  This is clearly a high-dimensional problem. To overcome this Grando fixes certain paramters in order to gain a better understanding of the remaining. She uses two methods; Nealder-Mead and Approximate Bayesian Computation. We will focus on the latter as it has provided superior results in her testing.

\subsection{Model Fitting}
We begin by trying to replicate Grando's results in order to establish a starting point. For ABC we require the prior distribution along with a summary statistic. Deriving the prior distribution is not a trivial problem. We not only have parameters for the HMM as well as parameters for the observations but have to  extract both from only the intensity values. 

Grando determines that even without the HMM parameters, the problem is high dimensional (3$m$ paramters). Due to this she decides to fix all HMM paramters to uniform(0,1) for each test, whilst insuring the transition matrix is stochastic through normalization of rows. She believes that this will allow her to retrieve close approximations of all $\lambda$,$\xi$ and $\tau$ from the data, which she can then use to calculate the HMM paramters. 

For each simulation she will generate a new value for all $\lambda$,$\xi$ and $\tau$. Then plot the summary statistic against the values for each and then find areas of high concentration to decide what a sutiable approximation for the true value of each is. Here she is setting her ABC tolerance to $\infty$ and then manually narrowing her range through the graph.

Grando picks values for each paramter using the uniform distribution between preset values. She says "This technique is purely heuristic and it is only aimed to explore the problem, as decisions made are completely arbitrary.". Theoretically we could pick any values for  but for consistency we will match the values she has used.  

She decides to use the mean intensity as her summary statistic for ABC. She calculates this for both the simulated and given data. She then calculates the normalised Euclidean distance between the two as her metric for model performance.


\section{Numerical Results}
We will be using the same algorithm, same data and same parameters as Grando to ensure consistency. Our data measures rainfall across 30 sites in Germany over the period from 1st of january 1931 to 31st December 2000. Co-ordinate data for each site is also given in an additional file. These are labeled as Easting and Northing. 

Grando fixes $m$=3, allowing for a low, medium and high state for rainfall. This gives us 21 unknown parameters of which we are attempting to estimate 9.

All programs have been run on the personal desktop (AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X with 12 Cores and 24 Threads running from 3.8GHz up to 4.6GHz) using C++20.

\subsection{Code}

To ensure validity of results, we wanted to run multiple tests. Grando's code was written in R and required multiple hours to produce a result. To improve on this we have rewritten the program in C++ and used Python on Jupyter Notebooks for analysis.

Data preperation took place in excel. For simplicity in importing into C++, the data needed to be configured in a particular way. This is described throughly in the notes given with the code. 

C++ was used for the actual simulation as this was the slowest part of Grandos algorithm. Many parameters have been hardcoded. This is to allow for efficiency and can later be altered if needed. Notes on mininpulating the code can be found **reference to later**. Multi-threading has been used for further reduction in run-time. Admittdely the code can be further parallised but in its current state it is acceptable; run times of under 5 minutes. 

Analysis was done using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. The C++ program created multiple CSV files as output and these were taken as input for analysis. 

\subsection{Results - Nine Parameter Estimation}

We begin with using ABC to estimate all parameters, found on pages 75-76 **Grando ref**. The parameters are picked as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\lambda_1 \sim \text{Unif(5,15)}$, $\lambda_2 \sim \text{Unif(16,25)}$ and $\lambda_3 \sim \text{Unif(26,35)}$
    \item $\xi_1 \sim \text{Unif(0.03,0.07)}$, $\xi_2 \sim \text{Unif(0.008,0.02)}$ and $\xi_3 \sim \text{Unif(0.001,0.007)}$
    \item $\tau_1 \sim \text{Unif(0.8,1.4)}$, $\tau_2 \sim \text{Unif(0.3,0.7)}$ and $\tau_3 \sim \text{Unif(0.07,0.2)}$
\end{itemize}

For each simulation we generate data for 365x5 days and calculate the normalised Euclidean distance between the mean of these and the mean of the whole given dataset. Due to random sampling we attempt to find estimates for all 9 parameters simultaneously. We completed 200 iterations on the personal desktop in 42.2841 seconds.

      \caption{Parameter values plotted against corresponding normalised Euclidean Distance between simulation and data means.}
      \label{allp}
\end{figure}
    
The results show ABC on nine parameters was not successful. Figure \ref{allp} shows for all parameters an extremly unifrom scatter suggesting the posterior distribution is still uniform in a neighbourhood of the true parameters. This is an exact match to Grando's results. 

\subsection{Results - Three Parameter Estimation}
\label{subsec3param}

Grando then decides to perform ABC on a subset of our nine parameters. She claims choosing only  $\lambda_i$,only $\xi_i$ or only $\tau_i$ does not yield better outcomes. She then goes on to test for only $\lambda_3$,$\xi_3$ and $\tau_3$, fixing all other parameters to abritary values. Once again, for consistency we choose values to match those of Grando.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\lambda_1 = 10$, $\lambda_2 = 20$ and $\lambda_3 =30$
    \item $\xi_1 = 0.05$, $\xi_2 = 0.01 $ and $\lambda_3 =0.005$
    \item $\tau_1 =1.1$, $\tau_2 = 0.5$ and $\tau_3 =0.1$
\end{itemize}

For each test we require three simulations. When computing for $\lambda_3$ we change its value from 30 to $\lambda_3 \sim \text{Unif(26,35)}$. Similarly, when computing for $\xi_3$, we change its value to $\xi_3 \sim \text{Unif(0.001,0.007)}$ and when computing for $\tau_3$ we change its value to $\tau_3 \sim \text{Unif(0.07,0.2)}$. At any given time there is one random variable between our nine that we are testing. For efficiency we process this over multiple threads. We completed 100 iterations and ran 5 attempts on the personal desktop. Attempt time ranged between 152.725 in to 199.386 seconds.

The graphs found in Figures \ref{singlelam}, \ref{singlexi} and \ref{singletau} correspond to the ones found in Grando’s *** REF** paper pages 78-80. We have come accross unexpected results. Although the graphs show a similar pattern, there is an inconnsistency in values.

    \end{subfigure}

    \caption{$\lambda_3$ values plotted against corresponding normalised Euclidean Distance between simulation and data means for 5 attempts.}
    \label{singlelam}
\end{figure}

For $\lambda_3$ Grando's estimate was 80.436. This was after running the algorithm in a larger interval. Although we have no done this, our data is sufficient to draw conclusions. We are expecting a minimum distance, in other words we expect the graph be a parabola in y; the parameter values.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The negative slope of \ref{singlelam:1} and \ref{singlelam:3} suggests the true value is larger than our upper limit of 35. 
    \item The positive slope of \ref{singlelam:2} and \ref{singlelam:5} suggests the true value is lower than our lower bound of 26. 
    \item \ref{singlelam:4} suggests the true value is somewhere within our interval of [26,35]. 
\end{itemize}
It is clear that not all three can be true as each contridicts the other. This suggests the value of $\lambda_3$ is changing through new attempts.

    \caption{$\xi_3$ values plotted against corresponding normalised Euclidean Distance between simulation and data means for 5 attempts.}
    \label{singlexi}
\end{figure}


For $\xi_3$ Grando's estimate was 0.0027. From our results we can deduce the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Both \ref{singlexi:1} and \ref{singlexi:3} suggest the true value is around 0.003. 
    \item \ref{singlexi:2} and \ref{singlelam:4} suggest the true value is between 0.005 and 0.006.
    \item The negative gradient of \ref{singlexi:5} suggests the true value larger than our upper limit of 0.007.
\end{itemize}
Although it seems the value remains within the interval most of the time, it does not remain consistent. Again, as with $\lambda_3$, these changes in estimated value suggest the true value may be changing through new attempts.

    \caption{$\tau_3$ values plotted against corresponding normalised Euclidean Distance between simulation and data means for 5 attempts.}
    \label{singletau}
\end{figure}


For $\tau_3$ Grando's estimate was 0.0386. From our results we can deduce the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The positive slope of \ref{singlexi:1} and \ref{singlexi:3} suggest the true value is below our lower bound of 0.07.
    \item \ref{singletau:2} suggests the true value is around 0.13.
    \item \ref{singletau:4} suggests the true value is around 0.10.
    \item The negative slope of \ref{singletau:5} suggests the true value is above our upper limit of 0.2.
\end{itemize}
Once again, multiple attempts provide contradicting results. This suggests the true value is chaning with each attempt.


\subsection{Adjusted ABC Algorithm}

From all \ref{singlelam}, \ref{singletau} and \ref{singlexi} we have the same indication; the parameter values are changing for new attempts. To justify this we must isolate the cause of this change. Our model requires our nine paramters to be constants. Furthermore, we have controlled the values of each in our testing, thus any change in paramter value must be caused by external factors. The only other factors within the model are the hidden markov paramters. 

Looking closely at our simulation algorithm, one may notice for each attempt the HMM parameters are generated by a uniform random variable and then kept the same for each simulation. In other words, they only change on new attempts. When we estiamte the parameters using ABC, we are conditioning on the paramters values we have preset; in particular the HMM paramters. Since these vary for each attempt, the condition our algorithm is based on varies for each attempt. Thus, we can confirm the model is different for each attempt and the parameters estimates are infact also different for each attempt. 
We can conclude ABC with the given algorithm has failed to provide parameter estiamtes. The increase in efficiency of the ABC algorithm has allowed for multiple attempts which has highlighted a flaw in the  algorithm itself. 

We can further highlight this issue through an adjustment to the ABC algorithm. We move the generation of HMM paramters to within the iterative process. This forces a new set of HMM paramters for each simulation. Whilst this would not be accurate to the model, this randomisation prevents the method providing parameter estiamtes that fit to a particular set of HMM paramters. We use this for three parameter estiamtion. We increase the number of iterations to 1000, to ensure we can find a pattern if there is one as there is an increase in randomisation. Using the same paramter values as \ref{subsec3param}, computation on the personal desktop took 652.842 seconds.

    \caption{Parameter values plotted against corresponding normalised Euclidean Distance between simulation and data means for simulation calculated using adjusted ABC algorithm}
    \label{adj}
\end{figure}


As we can see from Figures \ref{adj}, we have a somewhat uniform scatter. This suggests we are unable to find an parameter estimate for our non-HMM paramters without fixing the HMM paramters. Thus we must search for an alternative method of parameter estimation. Our method must support high-dimensional paramter estimation in our current model we have 21 unkowns.
