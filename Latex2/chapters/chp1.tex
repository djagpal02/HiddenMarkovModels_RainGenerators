The goal of this project is to determine if HMMs are suitable as rain generators.

The first task will be to extend on the work done by Grando. In her testing, she has concluded that HMMs are suitable as rain generators; however, she has used the same data for testing as she used for training.  Doing so may, quite likely, have to lead to bias, and thus, we will extend her work by conducting out-of-sample tests.

If possible, we will build the software, so it is user friendly and efficient. With this,  we can test data for multiple locations. This will allow us to understand if the result is genuinely significant, at least more than just one location.
