Maximum observation is 743, we set the max observations to 750

we test for the 3 state model

3 attempts with 100000 iterations, calculate the square difference of frequency for each mm of rain and select model with lowest.

we stick with 1000 observations per month to ensure we do not reach proabilities for alpha and beta that are too small for the computer to compute.


3 attempts, all 12 months are computed simulationly via seperate threads

attempt1 time - 1074.76 seconds
attempt2 time - 1081.38 seconds 
attempt3 time - 1076.16 seconds



out of sample test - using data rows 0-1000 for learning and 1000-2000 for testing

to improve results further, one can increase the number of attempts as each they converge to local optima and there may be a more optimum optima available. This should inturn provide a better B matrix, which should inturn allow for better simulation
