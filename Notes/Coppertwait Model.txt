- We will not delve into the details of point processes but they can be found in Grandos paper \ref

- Same for the nealder mead process, also used by coppertwait \ref

- MODEL 
The model has been adjusted and improved over many years \ref all. We will focus on the 2010 model but start with the properties shared by all.



Rainfall occurs in 2D cells (discs) - shape is arbritary
Features of rainfall are represented by known distributions.
1994: 
- poisson rate lambda of storm origin
- R.V> C of cell origin within each storm
-cell origin exponentially distributed from storm origin by parameter \beta
-each cell classed as one of n types
-duration of cell exponential r.v. \eta_i for cell type i
-Intensity of cell r.v. denoted X_i for cell type i
-mean number of cells per storm is denoted \mew_C for a type i cell, mean intensity as \mew_i(i=1,..,n)



Storm origins occur in a space-time poisson process \zeta_s
