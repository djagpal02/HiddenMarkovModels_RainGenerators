// A Generalized Point Process Model for Rainfall

where the two cell type
categorized as 'heavy' short-duration convective cells and 'light' long-durat stratiform cells


* Bartlett-Lewis Rectangular Pulses Model (BLRP)
*Neyman-Scott Recatangular Pulses Model (NSRP)
*Generalized NSRP (GNSRP)

GNSRP must be defined with the number of cell types. We use 2, one for heavy convective cells and one for light straiform cells.#


BLRP - Each storm origin is followed by another Poisson process of cell origins, which is terminated after a time that is exponetially distributed. Cell originis are independently uniformly distrubited over hte interval from the strom origin to the termination point. 

NSRP - Cell origins are independently displaced from each storm origin by distances that are exponentialy distrubuted. Thus, there is a greater probability that cells will cluster near the beggining of the storm. This is more realistic as rainfall has a tendencyt to be more inteense near the leading edge of some frontal systems (Browning 1985).

In this paper, these discrepancies are resolved by allowing
different 'types' of rain cell to exist within the same storm. This is appealing bedistinct precipitation areas have been identified in observational studies on rainf field

A GNSRP(1) model is identical to the original NSRP model



*** Through all his papers Coppertwait develops on his original model from 199*.
