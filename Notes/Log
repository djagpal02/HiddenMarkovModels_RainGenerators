Replicating Grando
- All Param
- Single Param
***********
My Model
-Adapting Grandos model

Data Prep
-Splitting into Months
-Focusing on only one site
-Discreteising observation data
******************
Baum Welch
- Calculate Matrix A B and vector Pi through iteration on recorded data
- Simulate using new parameters
(Works for all months - split over 12 threads)
- 3 attempts

Analysis - Jupyter notebooks
- Convergence log - see if it converges or not
- square difference between frequences in simulation and training data
- Choose attempt with smallest difference
- Hist with 0 comparison
- Hist without 0 comparison

*********

Parameter Estimation
- For given min and max lambda and tau, simulate rainfall, calculate frequencies and find absolute difference ebtween this and freq in row given by matrix B.
- Analysis done in R
- Plot 3D graph of lambda, tau and residual, look for minimum
- Repeat, optimising min and max lam and tau each time 
- Look for hyperbola in tau-residual and lam-residual graphs and find minimum. 
- Record minimum values as parameter estimates

Model Generation
- Simply go through HMM and other model features using parameter estimates found in prev.


******

Distribution Matching
- Kologmorov -smirnof test for matching distributions
- Analysis done on R file
- For each month find ks p value for training data - HMM simulation , training data - Model Simulation, Test data - HMM simulation and Test data - Model simulation
- Plot graphs of ecdf for all 3 datasets


conclusion
-HMMs have significant potential in describing rainfall patterns. For all K-S tests on training data we had insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis; the two datasets come from the same distribution. For the test set ( at 5% significance) we reject for only 4 out of 12 months. Considering the model parameters were selected from only 3 random starts of Baum-Welch, I am convinced that through an increased number of attempts and thus finding a more optimum local optimum we can find superior performance.
-Deriving the Cowpertwait/Grando parameters from the B matrix was not successful. We rejected the null hypothesis for every test, both training and test data.  
-Future work could entail increasing the number of attempts as mentioned in (1). Although our chosen model did not produce the desired result, finding a function of random variables that produce the rows of the B matrix would allow for simpler simulation and thus may be an area of interest. 

- Could try a model with higher number of states
