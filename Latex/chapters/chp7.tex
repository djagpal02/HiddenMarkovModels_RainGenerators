In this chapter we will extend on Grando's ideas, adapt her model and try to decide if HMMs are useful in rainfall models. To awnser the question we must solve a 21-dimensional problem.

My Model
-Adapting Grandos model

Data Prep
-Splitting into Months
-Focusing on only one site
- Discretizing observation data
baum Welch




\section{Disk Structure}

Simpliffy disks, every site has own disks

\section{Split monthly}

cowpertwait vs Grando

\section{High dimensionality}

Instead of approaching from non-hmm parameters, we approach from HMM parameters. use known methods to solve for hmms. Use baum welch. To create B matrix, discretise observation data.
