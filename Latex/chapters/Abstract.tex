Hidden Markov Models (HMM) allow us to explain some black-box systems, where we only have access to the observation, and the underlying system assumed Markovian. In this project, we seek to decide if these models provide any value in explaining the black-box system of rainfall.

We begin by replicating existing models by Cowperthwait and Grando to establish the known ability of HMM in rainfall simulation. We then provide an alternative approach to existing rainfall HMM parameter estimation, applying Baum-Welch to a discretised dataset. Finally, we attempt to generalise the model by generalising the HMMs observation matrix into a function of random variables.

We produce simulations using the HMM and the generalised HMM and compare, both graphically and numerically, the simulations to our dataset. 

While our function used for generalising was not successful, the HMM showed potential when compared to both test and training datasets.
