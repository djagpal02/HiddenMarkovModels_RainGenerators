The goal of this project is to determine if HMMs are suitable as rain generators.

The first task will be to extend on the work done by Grando. In her testing, she has concluded that HMMs are suitable as rain generators however she has used the same data for testing as she used for training.  This, quite likely,  has lead to bias and thus we will extend her work by conducting out-of-sample tests.

If possible, I will build the software so it is user friendly and efficient. With this,  I  can test data for multiple locations. This will allow me to understand if the result is truly significant, at least more so than just one location.
